# Register allocation

int _main(){
    int a;
    int b;
    a=35;
    b=45;
    int c;
    c=a+b;
    
    c=a-b;  #   here , i dont load a and b from memory again. Instead , i will directly access from registers as they r previously accessed

    c=a*b;  #   here , i dont load a and b from memory again. Instead , i will directly access from registers as they r previously accessed


# So, number of memory calls are only 2 instead of 6 , hence improving the performance
